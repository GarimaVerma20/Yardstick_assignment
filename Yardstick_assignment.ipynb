            "\n",
            "### **What is a Blood Moon?**  \n",
            "A Blood Moon occurs during a **total lunar eclipse**, when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow. The Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) more than longer ones (like red and orange). This scattering effect bends some sunlight around the Earth, casting a reddish glow on the Moon, giving it a **rusty, reddish-brown appearance**. \n",
            "\n",
            "### **Why \"Blood\"?**  \n",
            "The term **\"Blood Moon\"** isn't scientifically precise but refers to the Moon's reddish hue during the eclipse. This phenomenon has also been called a **\"Red Moon\"** or **\"Hunter's Moon\"** (if it occurs near autumnal equinoxes).\n",
            "\n",
            "### **Types of Lunar Eclipses**  \n",
            "- **Penumbral Lunar Eclipse**: The Moon passes through Earth's partial shadow, causing a subtle darkening.  \n",
            "- **Partial Lunar Eclipse**: Only part of the Moon enters Earth's umbra (direct shadow), creating a \"bite\" out of its edge.  \n",
            "- **Total Lunar Eclipse (Blood Moon)**: The entire Moon is engulfed in Earth's umbra, turning it red.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### **Frequency & Cultural Significance**  \n",
            "Blood Moons are relatively rare because the Sun, Earth, and Moon must align perfectly (syzygy). They're often associated with folklore, myths, or religious texts. For example, multiple Blood Moons in a short span are sometimes called a **\"Tetrad.\"**  \n",
            "\n",
            "### **Next Blood Moon?**  \n",

            "\n",
            "### **Viewing Tips**  \n",
            "- **No special equipment needed**: Just find a dark spot with a clear view of the Moon.  \n",
